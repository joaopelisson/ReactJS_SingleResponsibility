# ReactJS | Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ⚛️

This project explores the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** within the context of React applications. SRP is the first of the SOLID principles, which are essential for building software that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. By following SRP, you ensure that each component or module has one reason to change, leading to cleaner and more focused code.

## 🛠️ What is SOLID?

**SOLID** is an acronym for five design principles that guide developers in creating more maintainable and flexible software:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) — A class or component should have only one reason to change.
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Demonstrate how to apply the Single Responsibility Principle in React components.
- Show how to break down complex components into smaller, more focused ones.
- Provide practical examples of how to structure a React project following SRP best practices.

## 📂 What You'll Find

- **Code Example**: React components that adhere to SRP, each focusing on a single responsibility.
- **Component Decomposition**: Techniques for splitting large components into smaller, manageable pieces.
- **Best Practices**: Tips for maintaining clean, focused, and maintainable code by following SRP.
